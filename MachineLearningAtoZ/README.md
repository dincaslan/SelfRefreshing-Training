As part of self refreshing/training, I decided to refresh my ML and Python skills as well. 

There was a Udemy course that I registered a long time ago. **Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R + ChatGPT Prize [2024]** has basic examples that the participants need to complete themselves. So, I will sharing them here with comments.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks to this course, I learnt **Google Colab**. It is a Python-based notebook that allows modifications and collaborations on the code in your browser. It has pre-installed libraries for machine and deep learning.
This makes it easy to work on your code anywhere where you can access your google account. In case you need it! 

To activate a collaborator account, you need to have a Google account first. Then, go the documents and choose new. You will see *More* option. You can search Colab in the search toolbar to install it to your account. Voil√†!
