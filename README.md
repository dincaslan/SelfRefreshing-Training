# How to Train Yourself

I am a Molecular Biologist and Geneticist with a solid background in *Advanced Calculus, Introductory Statistics and Basics of Programming* (thanks to my undergrad curriculum). 

However, the applications of what I learned on my field was limited during the undergad years. When I did masters, I applied some of these concepts (by adding new ones) on my thesis project. during this time, I trained myself for more in *R and Data Visualization* as well as *bulk RNA-seq data analysis*. 

Later, I went back to wetlab during PhD. I did not have time for extensive Bioinformatics until the final year (of 4 years long PhD journey). Despite a solid background in *single-cell bioasssay development* during this process, this was not enough for me to stop learning (feel free to say "damn academics" (:). Moreover, I learnt *command line tools* and *single cell high-throughput data analysis* during these years. 

One thing I relized during the thesis writing process was I had blast of ideas when I focus on my work. This was super-exciting. The sad thing was my current skills sets in computational biology was not enough for what I was thinking little bit beyond the thesis (one might also think "alright, this is why there is something called collaboration"). I need time to learn how to use tools efficiently, how to code properly, refresh statistics knowledge. I gave priority to complete the thesis and move on. 

Now, I want to spend at least 2-3 years in computational biology focused studies to *reinforce and advance the skillsets* I have. I am not planning to stop (unless there is an external factors that I cannot control). So, I am planning to join these *self-training challenges* in a limited time interval for this purpose. This repository will be updated based on my selections and progress.
